## What do you think being a data scientist is about?

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

## How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

## Load the dataset

Here we load the `iris` dataset, which contains measurements of flowers.

```{r}
y <- density(iris$Petal.Width)
```

## Summarize the data

Now we compute summary statistics to see the overall structure of the dataset.

```{r}
y <- density(iris$Petal.Width)
class(y)
typeof(y)
str(y)

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
