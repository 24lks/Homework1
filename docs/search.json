    "text": "What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\nData scientists study structured data. Statisticians use mathematical and statistical methods to collect and interpret data. These careers are similar in their need for expertise in statistical analysis, knowledge of programming languages, and mathematical knowledge. They differ in their scope. Data science is new, and highly interdisciplinary. Statistics is much older, and while statisticians use technology they are also more likely to use mathematical concepts in their work. Data scientists are also high in demand in industry, where statisticians are more likely to be employed in academic, government or research positions. There are also differences in the focus of their work and tools they use to complete it."
